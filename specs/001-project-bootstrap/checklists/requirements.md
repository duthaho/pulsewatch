# Specification Quality Checklist: Project Bootstrap

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-31  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

**Summary**: 
- All 16 checklist items passed validation
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- User scenarios are independently testable and prioritized (P1-P3)
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Edge cases thoroughly documented
- Assumptions clearly stated

**Notes**:
- Specification intentionally mentions Django, MySQL, Docker in context because this is an infrastructure bootstrap phase where technology choices are part of the deliverable
- However, success criteria remain technology-agnostic focusing on measurable outcomes (e.g., "setup time under 15 minutes" rather than "Django starts successfully")
- All functional requirements are testable with clear acceptance scenarios
- No ambiguities or missing information identified
