# Implementation Plan: Project Bootstrap

**Branch**: `001-project-bootstrap` | **Date**: 2025-10-31 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-project-bootstrap/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Initialize the foundational Django + MySQL project structure for PulseWatch SaaS platform following Clean Architecture and DDD principles. This phase establishes development environment setup, Docker containerization, CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, and basic observability (structured logging + Prometheus metrics). The goal is to enable developers to clone, setup, and start contributing within 15 minutes with automated quality gates enforcing code standards.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Python 3.12
**Primary Dependencies**: Django 5.x, Django REST Framework 3.x, Celery 5.x, MySQL 8.x, Redis 7.x
**Storage**: MySQL 8.x (InnoDB) with read replicas, Redis for caching/sessions
**Testing**: pytest, pytest-django, pytest-cov (≥85% coverage), factory_boy for fixtures
**Target Platform**: Linux server (Docker containers on Kubernetes - AWS EKS or GKE)
**Project Type**: Web application (Django backend + REST API, optional Next.js frontend)
**Performance Goals**: <500ms p95 API latency, 1000+ concurrent users, 10k checks monitored
**Constraints**: Stateless app processes, <200ms database queries, horizontal scaling required
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-tenant SaaS, 10k+ users, 5 bounded contexts (users/monitoring/notifications/team/billing)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **Clean Architecture**: Feature establishes layered structure (core/apps/shared) with separation of concerns, though domain logic minimal in bootstrap phase
- [N/A] **Bounded Context**: Bootstrap is infrastructure setup, not a business bounded context. Prepares structure for future contexts (users, monitoring, etc.)
- [x] **Test-First**: Test infrastructure and sample health check tests will be written following TDD
- [x] **SOLID Principles**: Configuration and setup code will use dependency injection patterns, type hints enforced via mypy
- [x] **12-Factor Compliance**: Environment-based config via django-environ, Docker for dependencies, stateless design
- [x] **Observability**: Structured logging (structlog) + Prometheus metrics endpoint (/metrics) included in bootstrap
- [⚠️] **Security**: Secure defaults established (.env.example, secrets gitignored), though full auth/authz is Phase 2

**Justification for ⚠️ Security**: Bootstrap phase establishes security foundation (secure defaults, HTTPS optional) but does not implement full authentication/authorization as that belongs to Users bounded context (Phase 2). This is acceptable as no business endpoints exist yet.

**Structure Decision**: Selected Django monolith structure with modular settings and prepared bounded context organization. The `apps/` directory is initialized but empty in Phase 1, ready for future bounded contexts (users, monitoring, notifications, team, billing). The `core/` package contains shared infrastructure (settings, middleware, health checks) while `shared/` will hold reusable domain-agnostic components. This structure follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation between infrastructure concerns (core) and future business domains (apps).

## Complexity Tracking

> **No constitutional violations requiring justification.**

All constitution checks pass or are appropriately deferred to future phases. The bootstrap phase intentionally focuses on infrastructure setup without business logic, which is why some principles (like Bounded Context and full Security) are marked as N/A or partial implementation.

## Implementation Workflow Status

### Phase 0: Research & Technical Decisions ✅ COMPLETE

**Output**: `specs/001-project-bootstrap/research.md`

**Objective**: Resolve all "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" items from Technical Context.

**Decisions Made**:
1. ✅ Django project structure (apps/core/shared organization)
2. ✅ Environment configuration (django-environ with .env files)
3. ✅ Docker Compose setup (3-service stack: web, db, redis)
4. ✅ Structured logging (structlog with JSON output)
5. ✅ Metrics collection (django-prometheus)
6. ✅ Code quality tools (black, flake8, isort, mypy with pre-commit)
7. ✅ CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions with matrix testing)
8. ✅ Testing approach (pytest with pytest-django, 85% coverage minimum)
9. ✅ Developer experience (Makefile for common commands)
10. ✅ Security defaults (secure settings with .env.example template)

**Artifact Status**: research.md created with 10 sections documenting all technical decisions, rationales, alternatives, and best practices.

---

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts ✅ COMPLETE

**Outputs**:
- ✅ `specs/001-project-bootstrap/data-model.md`
- ✅ `specs/001-project-bootstrap/contracts/health.yaml`
- ✅ `specs/001-project-bootstrap/contracts/metrics.yaml`
- ✅ `specs/001-project-bootstrap/quickstart.md`

**Objective**: Document data structures, API contracts, and developer onboarding.

**Artifacts Created**:

1. **data-model.md** - Infrastructure schemas:
   - Environment variable schema (required and optional vars)
   - Health check response schemas (/healthz and /ready endpoints)
   - Prometheus metrics schema (baseline and custom application metrics)
   - Structured log schema (JSON format with required/optional fields)
   - Docker Compose configuration schema (service dependencies and volumes)
   - CI/CD pipeline schema (job dependencies and artifacts)

2. **contracts/health.yaml** - OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification:
   - `/healthz` endpoint (liveness probe)
   - `/ready` endpoint (readiness probe with dependency checks)
   - Response schemas with examples for healthy and unhealthy states
   - HTTP status codes (200 OK, 503 Service Unavailable)

3. **contracts/metrics.yaml** - Prometheus metrics specification:
   - `/metrics` endpoint in Prometheus text format
   - Django baseline metrics (HTTP, database, cache)
   - Custom application metrics (app_info, health_check_status)
   - Metric types: counter, gauge, histogram

4. **quickstart.md** - Developer onboarding guide (10 steps):
   - Prerequisites and installation verification
   - Repository cloning and environment setup
   - Docker Compose service orchestration
   - Database migrations and superuser creation
   - Verification steps (health checks, metrics, admin, tests)
   - Development workflow (hot reload, management commands)
   - Code quality tools (pre-commit hooks, formatting, linting)
   - Testing with coverage (85% minimum)
   - Troubleshooting common issues
   - Useful commands reference (Makefile targets)

**Agent Context Update**: ✅ Executed `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot` to update GitHub Copilot context file with Phase 1 artifacts.

---

### Phase 2: Task Breakdown ⏳ PENDING

**Command**: `/speckit.tasks` (separate command, run after Phase 1 completion)

**Objective**: Generate detailed implementation tasks organized by user story.

**Expected Output**: `specs/001-project-bootstrap/tasks.md`

**Task Organization**:
- **Phase 0: Setup** - Development environment initialization
- **Phase 1: Foundational Infrastructure** - Shared components (JWT, Celery, Prometheus, migrations)
- **Phase 2: User Stories** - Feature implementation by priority
  - [US1] Local Development Environment Setup
  - [US2] Containerized Development Environment
  - [US3] Automated Quality Checks and CI/CD

**Task Metadata**:
- Unique IDs (TASK-001, TASK-002, etc.)
- Estimated effort (Small/Medium/Large)
- Dependencies between tasks
- Parallel execution markers [P]
- User story association [US1], [US2], [US3]

**Next Steps**:
1. User runs: `/speckit.tasks`
2. System loads: spec.md, plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/
3. System generates: tasks.md with comprehensive task breakdown
4. User reviews and adjusts task estimates/priorities
5. Implementation begins following TDD workflow

---

## Ready for Implementation

All planning artifacts are complete. The implementation plan provides:

✅ **Clear Technical Direction** - Research resolves all unknowns
✅ **Data Structure Definitions** - Schemas for config, health, metrics, logs
✅ **API Contracts** - OpenAPI specs for health and metrics endpoints
✅ **Developer Onboarding** - Step-by-step quickstart guide with troubleshooting
✅ **Constitutional Alignment** - All principles evaluated and justified
✅ **Agent Context Updated** - AI assistants have current feature context

**Constitution Re-evaluation**: All checks remain PASS or appropriately justified. Phase 1 design artifacts do not introduce business logic, so Bounded Context and DDD patterns remain N/A for this phase.

**Next Action**: Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate implementation tasks breakdown.
