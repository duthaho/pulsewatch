# Feature Specification: Project Bootstrap

**Feature Branch**: `001-project-bootstrap`  
**Created**: 2025-10-31  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Project Bootstrap: Initialize the foundational project structure for a production-ready Django + MySQL SaaS platform following Clean Architecture and DDD"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-31

- Q: What security baseline should be enforced even in the development environment? → A: Secure defaults with documented overrides (HTTPS optional, strong random defaults, .env.example template with secrets gitignored)
- Q: What observability capabilities should be implemented in Phase 1 bootstrap? → A: Basic structured logging + health metrics (JSON logs with timestamp/level/context, Prometheus /metrics endpoint with health/startup metrics)
- Q: What should trigger the CI/CD pipeline execution? → A: All branches + required PR checks (CI runs on every push to any branch, PR merges blocked until CI passes, manual re-run allowed)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Local Development Environment Setup (Priority: P1)

A developer clones the repository and needs to set up a fully functional local development environment with all dependencies, database connections, and development tools configured correctly.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation for all development work. Without a working local environment, no features can be developed or tested. It's the entry point for every developer joining the project.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by cloning the repository, running setup commands, and verifying that the application starts successfully with database connectivity and passes basic health checks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer has cloned the repository, **When** they run the setup commands (install dependencies, initialize database), **Then** the development environment starts successfully with no errors
2. **Given** the development environment is running, **When** the developer accesses the health check endpoint, **Then** the system returns a successful health status indicating database connectivity
3. **Given** the development environment is configured, **When** the developer runs the test suite, **Then** all initial tests pass successfully
4. **Given** a developer makes code changes, **When** they attempt to commit, **Then** pre-commit hooks automatically run linting and formatting checks

---

### User Story 2 - Containerized Deployment (Priority: P2)

An operations engineer or developer needs to run the entire application stack (web server, database, cache) in isolated containers for consistent deployment across environments.

**Why this priority**: Containerization ensures environment parity between development, staging, and production. It eliminates "works on my machine" problems and simplifies deployment workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running Docker commands to start the containerized stack and verifying that all services (web, database, Redis) are running and communicating correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Docker is installed, **When** the engineer runs the container orchestration command, **Then** all services (web application, database, cache) start successfully
2. **Given** containers are running, **When** the engineer checks container health, **Then** all containers report healthy status
3. **Given** the containerized application is running, **When** the engineer accesses the application endpoint, **Then** the application responds successfully with database connectivity confirmed
4. **Given** containers need to be stopped, **When** the engineer runs the shutdown command, **Then** all containers shut down gracefully without data loss

---

### User Story 3 - Automated Quality Checks (Priority: P3)

A developer pushes code changes and the CI/CD pipeline automatically validates code quality, runs tests, and enforces project standards before allowing the code to be merged.

**Why this priority**: Automated quality gates maintain code quality and prevent defects from entering the codebase. While important, this can be added after basic development workflow is established.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by pushing commits to a feature branch and verifying that the CI/CD pipeline runs all quality checks and reports results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer pushes code to a feature branch, **When** the CI/CD pipeline triggers, **Then** all linting checks, type checks, and formatting validations run automatically
2. **Given** the CI/CD pipeline is running, **When** code quality checks complete, **Then** the pipeline reports pass/fail status with detailed feedback
3. **Given** code fails quality checks, **When** the developer views the pipeline results, **Then** specific errors and violations are clearly identified with line numbers
4. **Given** all quality checks pass, **When** the pipeline completes, **Then** the code is marked as ready for code review
5. **Given** a pull request is created, **When** CI checks are running or have failed, **Then** the pull request cannot be merged until all checks pass
6. **Given** a CI check fails due to a transient issue, **When** the developer requests a manual re-run, **Then** the pipeline re-executes without requiring a new code push

### Edge Cases

- What happens when database connection fails during startup? System should provide clear error messages indicating database connectivity issues
- What happens when required environment variables are missing? System should fail fast with informative error messages listing missing variables
- What happens when Docker containers fail to start due to port conflicts? System should detect and report port conflicts with guidance on resolution
- What happens when attempting to run migrations on an empty database? System should successfully create all required database schemas from scratch
- What happens when multiple developers work on the same database locally? Each developer's environment should be isolated with separate database instances

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a project structure organized into bounded contexts following Clean Architecture layers (domain, application, infrastructure, interface)
- **FR-002**: System MUST support environment-based configuration with separate settings for development and production environments
- **FR-003**: System MUST connect to MySQL database with proper connection pooling and error handling
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a health check endpoint that verifies application status and database connectivity
- **FR-005**: System MUST run in Docker containers with orchestration for all required services (web, database, cache)
- **FR-006**: System MUST enforce code quality through automated linting, type checking, and formatting tools
- **FR-007**: System MUST run automated tests through continuous integration pipeline on every push to any branch, with pipeline results visible within 5 minutes
- **FR-007a**: System MUST block pull request merges until all CI checks pass successfully, with option for manual re-run on transient failures
- **FR-008**: System MUST use pre-commit hooks to enforce code standards before commits are accepted
- **FR-009**: System MUST support database migrations for schema version control
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide clear documentation for setting up development environment
- **FR-011**: System MUST isolate dependencies using virtual environments or containers
- **FR-012**: System MUST use structured logging in JSON format with minimum fields: timestamp, log level, message, and context (request_id when applicable)
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide secure defaults for development environment with .env.example template showing required variables, strong random default passwords, and all secrets excluded from version control via .gitignore
- **FR-014**: System MUST support optional HTTPS in local development with documentation for enabling self-signed certificates when needed
- **FR-015**: System MUST expose a Prometheus-compatible /metrics endpoint reporting basic operational metrics (health status, application startup time, request count)

### Key Entities

This phase focuses on infrastructure setup and does not introduce business domain entities. The following infrastructure components are established:

- **Project Configuration**: Environment-specific settings, database connections, middleware configurations
- **Health Check**: Application status indicator with dependency health verification
- **Development Environment**: Local setup with database, cache, and development tools

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: New developers can set up a fully functional local development environment in under 15 minutes following the setup documentation
- **SC-002**: The application starts successfully in both local and containerized environments without manual intervention beyond initial configuration
- **SC-003**: Health check endpoint responds within 500ms and accurately reports the status of all critical dependencies (database, cache)
- **SC-003a**: All application logs are output in structured JSON format with consistent field names across all log entries
- **SC-003b**: Metrics endpoint exposes at least 3 operational metrics (health, startup time, request count) in Prometheus format
- **SC-004**: 100% of code commits pass automated quality checks (linting, type checking, formatting) before being merged
- **SC-005**: The containerized application can be stopped and restarted without data loss or configuration drift
- **SC-006**: CI/CD pipeline completes all quality checks in under 5 minutes for typical code changes
- **SC-007**: Development environment supports rapid iteration with code changes reflected within 3 seconds using hot reload

### Assumptions

- Developers have basic familiarity with command-line tools and Git
- Docker and Python are pre-installed on developer machines (or installation instructions are provided)
- MySQL 8.x is the target database version for both development and production
- Redis will be used for caching and session storage (infrastructure prepared but not actively used in Phase 1)
- GitHub Actions is the chosen CI/CD platform
- Default Django settings are suitable starting points and will be customized per environment
- Pre-commit hooks will use standard tools: black, flake8, isort, mypy
