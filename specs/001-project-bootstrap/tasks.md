## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - **BLOCKS all user stories**
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) completion
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) completion - Can run parallel with US1 if team capacity
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) completion - Can run parallel with US1/US2 if team capacity
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

```
Foundational (Phase 2)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User Story 1 (Phase 3) - Local Development Environment ‚úÖ MVP
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User Story 2 (Phase 4) - Containerized Environment (independent, can run parallel)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ User Story 3 (Phase 5) - CI/CD Pipeline (independent, can run parallel)
```

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: No dependencies on other stories - Can start immediately after Foundational

5. Documentation (T062-T064) - includes HTTPS setup instructions

**User Story 2 (Containerized Environment)**:
1. Docker configuration (T065-T072) - core Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml first
2. Environment integration (T073-T075) - can run parallel with Docker config
3. Docker testing (T076-T079) - sequential validation
4. Documentation (T080-T081)

**User Story 3 (CI/CD Pipeline)**:
1. Pipeline configuration (T082-T089) - lint and test jobs can be defined in parallel
2. Branch protection documentation (T090-T091)
3. CI/CD documentation (T092-T094) - can run parallel
4. Pipeline testing (T095-T099) - sequential validation

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only - Recommended)

1. **Complete Phase 1**: Setup (T001-T010) ‚Üí ~2 hours
2. **Complete Phase 2**: Foundational (T011-T045) ‚Üí ~1 day (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. **Complete Phase 3**: User Story 1 (T046-T062) ‚Üí ~4 hours
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**:
   - Run quickstart.md steps 1-9
   - Test health endpoints: curl http://localhost:8000/healthz
   - Run test suite: pytest
   - Verify pre-commit hooks: git commit
5. **Deploy/Demo if ready**: MVP is functional local development environment

**Total MVP Time Estimate**: 1.5-2 days for a single developer

---

### Incremental Delivery (All User Stories)

1. **Complete Setup + Foundational** (Phase 1-2) ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. **Add User Story 1** (Phase 3) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **MVP delivered!**
3. **Add User Story 2** (Phase 4) ‚Üí Test Docker environment ‚Üí Deploy
4. **Add User Story 3** (Phase 5) ‚Üí Test CI/CD pipeline ‚Üí Deploy
5. **Polish** (Phase 6) ‚Üí Final validation ‚Üí Production ready

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

**Total Time Estimate**: 3-4 days for a single developer (with parallel work: 2-3 days with team)

---

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers:

1. **All team members**: Complete Setup + Foundational together (Phase 1-2) ‚Üí ~1.5 days
2. **Once Foundational is complete, split**:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Phase 3) ‚Üí ~4 hours
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Phase 4) ‚Üí ~3 hours
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 (Phase 5) ‚Üí ~4 hours
3. **All team members**: Polish together (Phase 6) ‚Üí ~2 hours

**Total Time with Parallel Execution**: 2 days with 3 developers

---

## Task Summary

| Phase | Task Range | Count | Estimated Time |
|-------|------------|-------|----------------|
| Phase 1: Setup | T001-T010 | 10 | 2 hours |
| Phase 2: Foundational | T011-T045 | 35 | 1 day |
| Phase 3: User Story 1 | T046-T064 | 19 | 4.5 hours |

| Phase 6: Polish | T100-T116 | 17 | 2 hours |
| **Total** | **T001-T116** | **116** | **~2-3 days** |

**Parallel Opportunities**: 45+ tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (39% of all tasks)

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-3 only (64 tasks, ~1.5-2 days) delivers functional local development environment

## Validation Checklist

Before marking feature complete:

- [ ] All 116 tasks completed and checked off
- [ ] Quickstart.md successfully validated (all 10 steps work)
- [ ] Health endpoints return correct JSON schema per contracts/
- [ ] Test suite passes with 85%+ coverage
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs successfully on feature branch
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks prevent commits with quality issues
- [ ] Docker environment starts/stops gracefully
- [ ] README.md accurately reflects setup process
- [ ] New developer can setup in <15 minutes (success criteria SC-001)

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - safe to parallelize
- **[Story] labels**: Track which user story each task serves
- **Each user story is independently completable**: Can deliver US1 as MVP, then add US2 and US3 incrementally
- **Foundational phase is BLOCKING**: Must complete before any user story work begins
- **Tests validate success criteria**: Health endpoint tests ensure SC-003, integration tests ensure SC-002
- **Follow TDD where specified**: Though not mandated, health endpoint tests should be written before implementation
- **Commit frequently**: After each task or logical group
- **Validate at checkpoints**: Stop after each phase to ensure story works independently
- **Use absolute paths**: Always reference full file paths in task descriptions
