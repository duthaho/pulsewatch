## Architecture Compliance (PulseWatch Constitution)

- [ ] CHK001 Clean Architecture: Domain layer has no Django imports (pure Python entities/value objects)
- [ ] CHK002 Clean Architecture: Application layer depends only on domain protocols/abstractions
- [ ] CHK003 Clean Architecture: Infrastructure implements application protocols (repository pattern)
- [ ] CHK004 Clean Architecture: Interface layer (views/serializers) depends on use cases, not models directly
- [ ] CHK005 DDD: Feature belongs to correct bounded context (users/monitoring/notifications/team/billing)
- [ ] CHK006 DDD: Domain events used for cross-context communication (decoupled)
- [ ] CHK007 DDD: Ubiquitous language used consistently in code and documentation

## Code Quality

- [ ] CHK008 Type hints on all public functions and class attributes (mypy strict mode passes)
- [ ] CHK009 PEP 8 compliance (black formatter applied, flake8 passes)
- [ ] CHK010 Google-style docstrings on all public APIs
- [ ] CHK011 SOLID: Single responsibility principle followed (one reason to change per class)
- [ ] CHK012 SOLID: Dependency injection via protocols (no hard-coded implementations)
- [ ] CHK013 No fat Django models (business logic in domain/application layers)

## Testing

- [ ] CHK014 TDD: Tests written and approved before implementation
- [ ] CHK015 Unit tests for domain entities (no mocks, pure logic tests in tests/unit/)
- [ ] CHK016 Integration tests for use cases (test database in tests/integration/)
- [ ] CHK017 Contract tests for API endpoints (DRF TestClient in tests/contract/)
- [ ] CHK018 Code coverage ≥ 85% (pytest-cov report passes)
- [ ] CHK019 All tests pass in CI (GitHub Actions green)

## Security

- [ ] CHK020 Input validation via DRF serializers (reject malformed requests)
- [ ] CHK021 Authentication enforced (JWT via djangorestframework-simplejwt)
- [ ] CHK022 Authorization checks at use case layer (RBAC: Owner/Member/Viewer)
- [ ] CHK023 No raw SQL with user input (Django ORM only, parameterized queries)
- [ ] CHK024 Secrets in environment variables (no hardcoded keys/passwords)
- [ ] CHK025 HTTPS enforced in production settings (SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True)
- [ ] CHK026 Rate limiting on authentication endpoints (django-ratelimit configured)

## Observability

- [ ] CHK027 Structured logging with context (user_id, request_id via structlog)
- [ ] CHK028 Prometheus metrics for endpoint (rate, errors, duration tracked)
- [ ] CHK029 OpenTelemetry tracing for distributed calls (Django → Celery → external APIs)
- [ ] CHK030 Error tracking configured (Sentry captures exceptions with context)

## 12-Factor Compliance

- [ ] CHK031 Config via environment variables (django-environ used, no hardcoded settings)
- [ ] CHK032 Stateless processes (no in-memory state, use MySQL/Redis for persistence)
- [ ] CHK033 Backing services as URLs (DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL in .env)
- [ ] CHK034 Health/readiness endpoints implemented (/health, /ready for K8s probes)
- [ ] CHK035 Logs to stdout/stderr (no file logging, aggregated by container runtime)

## Database

- [ ] CHK036 Django migrations created and tested (./manage.py makemigrations)
- [ ] CHK037 Migrations are reversible (down migration tested)
- [ ] CHK038 No N+1 queries (django-debug-toolbar or django-silk verified)
- [ ] CHK039 Database indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried fields
- [ ] CHK040 Transactions used for multi-step operations (atomic blocks)
